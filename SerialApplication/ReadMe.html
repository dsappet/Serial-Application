    <title>C# Serial Listener with Write / Reply / Loop write capabilities</title>

            <b>About: </b> Initially this program was designed to perform a more specific task with the serial port for
            testing specific hardware. I have tried to make it more general purpose and make it configurable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Written in C# the program utilizes the system.IO functions for access to the serial port. The listener
            function subscribes to an event fired when data is received on the port. The program has an option to 
            send a reply string every time data is received on the port. The write button can write just once, usually
            used to write then wait for a reply. The looping functionality writes the string in the input box.

            <b>TODO: </b> 
            <ul>
                <li>Separate out the serial functions into a class. They are currently all just embeded in the form code.</li>
                <li>Add stop button to halt loop write function.</li>
                <li>Fix the form appearance and colors, I was messing around with it and haven't fixed it yet.</li>
                <li>Add form variable to adjust delay in loop write function.</li>
                <li>Add logging capabilities. Save screen dump to txt file, or perhaps database support.</li>
            </ul>
